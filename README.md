# React Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document my daily learnings and coding exercises from a **React** course. This repository serves as a collection of small projects, concepts, and snippets I practice every day while learning React.

## Purpose
This repo is meant for me to:
- Track my progress and practice React step by step.
- Experiment with different React concepts and libraries.
- Build small, independent components and projects.

## How to Use This Repository
- Each day’s learning will be stored in its own folder or file.
- Every commit will correspond to a new topic, concept, or project I’ve learned that day.

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS
- (Optional: Add any libraries or tools like React Router, Redux, etc., as you move forward and this is test)
